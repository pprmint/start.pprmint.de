# start.pprmint.de

A clock and a search bar.

This was originally just meant to be a little playground for me to build (janky) clocks and has turned into my browser's start page now. It's still work in progress with stuff to be added, changed and fixed.

By the by, I can't see what you are searching for. Your query is merely inserted as a parameter in the URL of your chosen search engine, to which you will be redirected when you hit Enter. I don't keep logs on my SearXNG instance (Inquest) either.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You know the drill.
